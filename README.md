# Project description
We quanitifed individual consumption of human foods by Steller's Jays (cyanocitta stelleri) using d13C 
as a proxy, and then assessed correlations between individual human food consumption and several
measures of fitness (body mass, growth bar width, and annual fecundity). We analyzed adults and juveniles 
separately. 


## Description of the Data and file structure
There is one csv file for each analysis:
Comparing adult and juvenile human food consumption: "d13C_AgeComparison.csv"
Adult body mass: "BodyMass_AHY.csv"
Juvenile body mass: "BodyMass_HY.csv"
Adult growth bar width: "GrowthBarWidth_AHY.csv"
Juvenile growth bar width: "GrowthBarWidth_HY.csv"
Fecundity of adult males: "Fecundity_AHY_M.csv"

Code to reproduce the analysis is available in the R file: "AnalysisCode_Ne_etal_2023.R"
